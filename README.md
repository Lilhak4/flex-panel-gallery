# Flex Panel Gallery
## 5 out of 30
This repository is part of an ongoing program created by Wes Bos to improve on various skills pertaining to javascript. This exercise showed how to use CSS to transform and translate different elements when clicking on certain divs to make it look like javascript was being implemented. I learnt about css transform and translate as well as nesting flexbox displays.
